      <p>Iran’s former leader seeks to regain office</p>
      <p>TEHRAN — Iran’s hard-line former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad registered Sunday as a possible candidate for the presidential election, seeking to regain the country’s top political position after a helicopter crash killed the nation’s president.</p>
      <p>The former leader’s registration puts pressure on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In office, Mr. Ahmadinejad openly challenged the 85-year-old cleric, and his attempt to run in 2021 was barred by authorities.</p>
      <p>The Holocaust-questioning politician registered at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the West over Tehran’s advancing nuclear program, its arming of Russia in its war against Ukraine, and its crackdowns on dissent.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Iran’s support of militia proxy forces throughout the Mideast have been in increased focus as Yemen’s Houthi rebels attack ships in the Red Sea over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ahmadinejad is the most prominent candidate to register so far. Speaking after his registration, he vowed to seek “constructive engagement” with the world and improved economic relations with all nations.</p>
